source servers.
 http://www.sample1.com
 http://www.sample2.com
 http://www.sample3.com


caching methods
a) request-caching
 key for caching is
  http://www.sample.com/.*

b) origin-caching
 key for caching is
  http://www.sample1.com/.*
  http://www.sample2.com/.*
  http://www.sample3.com/.*

What's the difference?
 if no change or update config of proxy, there is no difference.

a) should be slitely faster, since no url mapping would occur in case of cache
b) should be roboust, it holds cache data par origin server basis.
 i.e. in case of sample3 has changed, purge is needed for sample3.com, not for whole sample.com.
